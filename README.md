### Calendy
Allows users to 

- Users can create a schedule of available dates and times and select their desired meeting intervals 
(15 min / 30 min / 45 min) 
- allow the user to do CRUD operations ( create / read / update / delete ) on his available schedule
- Non-users can view all available timings for a specific user
- Non-users can reserve a specific time by providing their full name and email for the meeting
- Non-user canâ€™t reserve a time that has been already reserved
